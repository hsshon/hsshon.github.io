Project Description 

- Conducted a national-standard preliminary feasibility study for a new arterial corridor, integrating demand forecasting, network assignment, and economic/environmental appraisal to compare do-nothing, do-minimum, and staged-build alternatives.

Role & Contributions 

- Coded base and project networks in EMME and calibrated origin–destination matrices using observed traffic counts and travel times.

- Built future-year scenarios (land use, socio-economic growth, induced demand), ran multi-class assignments, and quantified travel-time, reliability, vehicle operating-cost, safety, and emissions impacts.

- Developed the cost–benefit model (capital and maintenance costs, user benefits, externalities) and computed net present value, benefit–cost ratio, and economic internal rate of return, with sensitivity and risk analyses.

- Produced policy-facing maps, tables, and a summary brief to support go/no-go and phasing decisions.

Methods & Tools

- EMME (v3), Python, Excel/VBA, QGIS; cost–benefit analysis, capacity and speed–flow analysis, emissions-factor methods.
