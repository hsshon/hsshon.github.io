Project Description 

- Delivered a country-tailored strategy for a national road asset management system: carried out a local diagnostic and institutional review; benchmarked Korean best practices; and produced a master plan, data model, condition indices, prioritization/budgeting processes, training for officials, and a phased implementation roadmap with a trial application concept.

Role & Contributions 

- Led the field diagnostic and stakeholder consultations; compared Koreaâ€“Dominican approaches to derive improvement tasks and roadmap items.
  
- Designed the framework: specified modules for condition survey/evaluation, repair-method determination, repair-priority setting, and budget allocation; defined the supporting web-based database and annual update workflow.
  
- Defined data collection schemas for the inventory and condition layers (e.g., segment attributes, ancillary structures, drainage, climate/land-use), ensuring compatibility with operations and planning.
  
- Proposed prioritization principles that account for Dominican climate and disaster frequency (rainy-season flooding, hurricanes/earthquakes), emphasizing preventive maintenance to reduce long-run social costs.
  
- Organized and delivered capacity-building: initiation/interim/final briefings and online training for public officials; consolidated feedback into the final strategy.
  
- Authored the phased implementation roadmap and trial-application plan to move from detailed design to deployment and monitoring.

Methods & Tools 

- Policy and institutional analysis; asset inventory and pavement-condition index design; maintenance prioritization and budgeting logic; preventive-maintenance economics; GIS-based data modeling; technical writing and stakeholder facilitation.
