Project Descriptions

- Built EMME-based multimodal network scenarios and performed traffic assignment to quantify travel-time savings, safety, and emissions as inputs to cost-benefit analysis. 


Role & Contributions

- Engineered detection logic for meter-off illegal operations by computing “empty-to-empty return” frequencies and flagging top-risk vehicles based on distribution thresholds. 

- Developed a map-matching pipeline to classify positions as inside vs. outside the licensed service area, derive boundary-crossing timestamps, and summarize four characteristic movement patterns (e.g., board→out→board, board→out→empty, etc.). 

- Extracted detailed trip records for suspected cases—including last normal drop-off, exit and re-entry times, and origin/destination and fare—to enable targeted enforcement and review. 

- Profiled frequent outside-area destinations and peak operating times of suspected vehicles to guide field inspections and policy. 

- Built the data foundation by integrating boarding/alighting coordinates and times, DTG positional traces, and official service-area polygons. 

- Delivered visual and tabular outputs (distributions, ranked lists) for inclusion in the system’s analysis module and reporting. 

Methods & Tools

- Python, geospatial analysis and map matching (DTG GPS trajectories), time-series processing, rule-based and statistical scoring.
