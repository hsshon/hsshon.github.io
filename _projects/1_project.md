Project Descriptions
Built analytics on DTG taxi data to support compliance monitoring and operational insights. Designed algorithms and workflows to detect “meter-off” and out-of-service-area operations, and produced audit-ready outputs (tables, lists, and distribution graphs) for the authority and operator.

Role & Contributions
Engineered detection logic for meter-off illegal operations by computing “empty-to-empty return” frequencies and flagging top-risk vehicles based on distribution thresholds. 
Developed a map-matching pipeline to classify positions as inside vs. outside the licensed service area, derive boundary-crossing timestamps, and summarize four characteristic movement patterns (e.g., board→out→board, board→out→empty, etc.). 
Extracted detailed trip records for suspected cases—including last normal drop-off, exit and re-entry times, and origin/destination and fare—to enable targeted enforcement and review. 
Profiled frequent outside-area destinations and peak operating times of suspected vehicles to guide field inspections and policy. 
Built the data foundation by integrating boarding/alighting coordinates and times, DTG positional traces, and official service-area polygons. 
Delivered visual and tabular outputs (distributions, ranked lists) for inclusion in the system’s analysis module and reporting. 

Methods & Tools
Python, geospatial analysis and map matching (DTG GPS trajectories), time-series processing, rule-based and statistical scoring.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
