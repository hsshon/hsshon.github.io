Project Description 

- Advanced a two-track program for pavement/transport assets: (1) system-level, multi-scale optimization that links budget allocation, group-level inspection, and facility-level maintenance to minimize discounted social costs; and (2) an autonomous, connected-vehicleâ€“based condition-monitoring concept that feeds real-time data into decision models to cut life-cycle costs.

Role & Contributions

- Formulated a bottom-up optimization framework that couples system-, group-, and facility-level decisions; modeled facility dynamics with Markov decision processes and solved using function approximation and Lagrangian relaxation; validated on a real roadway network near Daejeon. 
 
- Specified inspection frequency and grouping logic to reflect heterogeneous deterioration/traffic environments, enabling adaptive group-specific inspection plans under budget limits. 

- Designed a connected-vehicle condition-monitoring concept: normal vehicles stream vibration/images/GPS to estimate current conditions, integrate data, and inform maintenance timing and policy. 
 
- Structured the social-cost objective and cost models balancing user and agency costs (and extensible to environmental externalities). 

- Implemented prototype analytics and scenario studies in Python to quantify network-level benefits under uncertainty (inspection accuracy, frequency, timing).

Methods & Tools 

- Life-cycle cost analysis; Markov decision processes; function approximation and Lagrangian relaxation; stochastic/dynamic optimization; scenario analysis; Python.

Results

- Published in Transportation Research Part C (2021) and Automation in Construction (2022); numerical experiments show the autonomous monitoring approach reduces social costs versus conventional periodic-inspection PMS.
