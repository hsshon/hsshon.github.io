Project Description 

- Designed the operations-center architecture and algorithms that connect roadside video infrastructure with mobility services. Built an end-to-end prototype in which closed-circuit television (CCTV) streams are ingested, analyzed, and converted into hazard alerts for autonomous vehicles and the control dashboard (e.g., occlusions, low-visibility, wrong-way or stopped vehicles).

Role & Contributions 

- Defined the system blueprint (data ingestion, processing, event rules, alerting, dashboard) and the interfaces with city sensors and service providers.
  
- Implemented the video-analytics pipeline: stream capture → pre-processing → object detection and tracking → event logic → alert packaging and delivery.
  
- Prototyped alert delivery to vehicles/center via lightweight messaging and built a simple operator view for triage and acknowledgment.

Methods & Tools 

- Convolutional neural networks for video analytics, Python, PyTorch, streaming and message-queue integration.
