Project Description 

-Designed the operations-center architecture and algorithms that connect roadside video infrastructure with mobility services. Built an end-to-end prototype in which closed-circuit television (CCTV) streams are ingested, analyzed, and converted into hazard alerts for autonomous vehicles and the control dashboard (e.g., occlusions, low-visibility, wrong-way or stopped vehicles).

Role & Contributions 

- Defined the system blueprint (data ingestion, processing, event rules, alerting, dashboard) and the interfaces with city sensors and service providers.
- Implemented the video-analytics pipeline: stream capture → pre-processing → object detection and tracking → event logic → alert packaging and delivery.
- Prototyped alert delivery to vehicles/center via lightweight messaging and built a simple operator view for triage and acknowledgment.
- Authored deployment guidelines (camera placement, latency targets, failover, privacy considerations) and scenarios for field piloting and scale-up.

Methods & Tools 

- Convolutional neural networks for video analytics, Python, PyTorch, streaming and message-queue integration.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
