Alleviating traffic congestion in metropolitan areas has been a persistent challenge for decades, leading to increased interest in aerial mobility solutions. Recent advancements in distributed electric propulsion, battery technology, and autonomous navigation have made electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft a feasible option for intercity transport. For efficient UAM systems, we optimize the high-level planning of UAMs, i.e., determine the numbers of eVTOLs, vertiport spaces, and chargers, together with lower-level operations to control each eVTOL’s operational state between in-service, charging, idling, and relocating. Accounting for spatio-temporal demand and cost heterogeneity, we formulate the UAM optimization framework as a mixed-integer programming problem. In our numerical study, we analyze a scenario involving three hypothetical vertiports in the Seoul Metropolitan Area, South Korea. The results reveal relationships between the optimal solution and several exogenous factors critical to eVTOL operations, including the targeted level of service for users and eVTOL charging speed. Additionally, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the robustness of our solution against stochastic demand and variations in electric consumption.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="PEREZ2025135" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Advanced Air Mobility for commuting?

However, its feasibility has not been thoroughly studied nor well understood at the operational level. Given that AAM has not been in place, this study explores the economic, energy, and environmental feasibility of AAM for commuting at an early stage of AAM deployment. We propose a time-expanded network model to characterize the dynamics of eVTOL operations between a vertiport pair in different states: in-service flying, relocation flying, charging, and parking, while respecting various operational and commuter time window constraints. By jointly considering eVTOL flying with vertiport access and egress and using real-world data, we demonstrate an application of the model in the Chicago metropolitan area in the US. Different vertiport pairs and eVTOL aircraft models are investigated. We find substantial travel time saving if commuting by AAM. While vehicle operating cost will be higher using eVTOLs than using auto, the generalized travel cost will be less for commuters. On the other hand, with current eVTOL power requirement, the energy consumption and CO2 emissions of AAM will be greater than those of auto driving, with an important contributor being the significance presence of empty flights relocation. These findings, along with sensitivity analysis, shed light on future eVTOL development to enhance the competitiveness of AAM as a viable option for commuting.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div id="Shon01042024" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Optimal planning of urban air mobility systems accounting for ground access trips</div> <div class="author"> <em>Heeseung Shon</em>, Sanggyu Kim, and Jinwoo Lee </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>International Journal of Sustainable Transportation</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15568318.2024.2311125" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> The concept of Urban Air Mobility (UAM), an on-demand aviation service using air vehicles for urban short-distance trips, such as electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOL), has recently drawn public attention as one of possible solutions to traffic congestion in metropolitan areas. We present an optimal planning framework for fleet size and vertiport numbers using generalized cost models of UAM trip chains with two different ground access modes for first and last mile trips, including taxis and robotaxis (i.e. autonomous taxis or shared autonomous vehicles). As it is a relatively new and untested mode of transportation, our research aims to provide a decision-making tool for initial UAM system planning and analysis of its economic feasibility, appropriately considering its unique characteristics, such as high free-flow speed, low circuity, needs for ground access, and specific cost factors, such as vertiport and electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft costs. Through a parametric study, we quantitatively examine the necessary conditions for UAM, with or without ridesharing, to become more economically viable than other ground-only modes. The study confirms that UAM can have potential economic benefits especially in large cities with longer average trip lengths and severe traffic congestion, where the average ground vehicle speed is low. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="88190" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Analysis of Traffic Load Reduction Effects of Overloading Enforcement System from a Traffic Assignment Perspective</div> <div class="author"> MyungKeun Jeong, <em>Heeseung Shon</em>, JongWoo Kim, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

However, increasing market penetration of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offers opportunities to monitor pavement conditions more frequently through sensors, including vision cameras and accelerometers, originally installed for autonomous driving. In this paper, we proposed an autonomous condition monitoring-based pavement management system (ACM-PMS) with real-time data collection using CAVs traveling voluntarily. We presented a novel mathematical framework to evaluate potential benefits of ACM-PMS in reducing social costs for both users and agency, systematically accounting for its unique three advantages: (i) large amount of condition data increases prediction model accuracy; (ii) aggregated measurement of current facility condition improves inspection accuracy; (iii) agency can perform maintenance activities at optimal timings, achieving continuous-time and condition-based policies. Results of numerical examples confirm that ACM-PMS significantly reduces the social cost of conventional PMS.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="LEE2021103066" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Optimal fleet, battery, and charging infrastructure planning for reliable electric bus operations</div> <div class="author"> Jinwoo Lee, <em>Heeseung Shon</em>, Ilia Papakonstantinou, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

Motivated by this, we assume a scenario in which a single existing bus route is operated by battery-electric buses and find the optimal planning by determining the number of chargers, the electric bus fleet size, and the battery capacity. While decision-making, it is necessary to guarantee that all scheduled tasks are completed with reliability against stochastic electricity consumption. We discover that a large fleet size and a high charging infrastructure capacity can reduce the minimum necessary battery capacity, and this tradeoff is crucial in the optimization. We demonstrate the proposed framework using electric bus operation data collected in Jeju, Korea, and find that the optimal electrification of a bus route can be economically and environmentally beneficial.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="SHON2021103328" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Integrating multi-scale inspection, maintenance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction decisions into system-level pavement management systems</div> <div class="author"> <em>Heeseung Shon</em> and Jinwoo Lee </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies</em>, 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2021.103328" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We are presenting a pavement management framework that involves multi-scale decisions, including system-level budget allocations, group-level inspections, and facility-level maintenance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction (MR&amp;R) strategies. We consider two objectives: (i) to minimize the total discounted cost for the main stakeholders, represented by the agency and users; and (ii) to minimize the discounted user costs under a limited agency budget. Inspection technology innovations have enabled us to investigate the conditions of a group of multiple roadway facilities almost simultaneously, using instrumented vehicles that can travel at the same speed as traffic. Previous related studies have primarily focused on, at most, a bi-level structure with all the managerial activities, such as inspection and MR&amp;R at the facility level and the allocation of a pooled budget at the system level. However, this cannot reflect the current group-level inspection practice, positioned between the facility and system levels. The proposed methodology adopts a bottom-up approach to account for heterogeneous facility- and group-specific properties, and it optimally facilitates determination of the multi-scale decisions to minimize the discounted societal costs. We address the complex multi-scale problem efficiently by adopting the Markov Decision Process, function approximation, and Lagrangian relaxation. As a numerical study, we analyze a real-world roadway network, including three expressway groups and one local road group, near Daejeon City in Korea. The system-level optimal solutions for the multi-scale decisions are determined, and the impacts of the grouping method are investigated.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div id="app9102149" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Enhanced Application of Principal Component Analysis in Machine Learning for Imputation of Missing Traffic Data</div> <div class="author"> Yoon-Young Choi, <em>Heeseung Shon</em>, Young-Ji Byon, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

Although the spatiotemporal dependency-based approaches can improve the imputation performance for large and continuous missing patterns, additionally considering traffic states can lead to more reliable results. In order to improve the imputation performances further, a section-based approach is also needed. This study proposes a novel approach for identifying traffic-states of different spots of road sections that comprise, namely, a section-based traffic state (SBTS), and determining their spatiotemporal dependencies customized for each SBTS, for missing value imputations. A principal component analysis (PCA) was employed, and angles obtained from the first principal component were used to identify the SBTSs. The pre-processing was combined with a support vector machine for developing the imputation model. It was found that the segmentation of the SBTS using the angles and considering the spatiotemporal dependency for each state by the proposed approach outperformed other existing models.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Heeseung Shon.
