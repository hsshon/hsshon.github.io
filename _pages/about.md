Dr. Heeseung Shon is an independent transportation systems researcher whose work spans infrastructure asset management, mobility optimization, and emerging air mobility. 

He earned his Ph.D. in the Graduate School of Mobility at KAIST in 2023, after M.S. (2019) and B.S. (2017) degrees in Civil & Environmental Engineering at Korea University. Most recently, he served as a postdoctoral researcher at KAIST and the University of Illinois Chicago.

His methods blend modeling, convex optimization, and Markov decision processes with big-data analytics and deep learning. Application areas include autonomous condition-monitoring–based pavement management, transit and electric-bus operations, and Advanced Air Mobility planning. 

Honors include multiple Best Paper Awards (2020–2022) and a Presidential Award from the Korean Society of Transportation. He is proficient in Python, MATLAB, and R, and experienced with optimization tools such as Gurobi and CPLEX.
